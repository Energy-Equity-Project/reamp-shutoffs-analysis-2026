# CLAUDE.md — reamp-shutoffs-analysis-2026

## Purpose
Energy burden, energy insecurity, utility shutoff, and utility profits analysis for RE-AMP
Midwest states. Produces per-state and per-FPL-bracket energy burden metrics (DOE LEAD),
self-reported energy insecurity rates (Household Pulse Survey), state-level shutoff counts,
rates, and US-wide rankings (EIA Form 112), and utility-level profit metrics and rankings
(EPI, 2021–2025).

## Type

## RE-AMP States
MI, OH, IN, IL, WI, MN, IA, ND, SD, KS (10 Midwest states)

## Methodology
- **Affordability threshold**: energy burden > 6% of income (DOE standard)
- **Aggregation unit**: census tract × FPL bracket (`state`, `fip`, `fpl150`) — avoids
  double-counting across the tenure/fuel cohort dimensions (`ten_ybl6`, `ten_bld`, `ten_hfl`)
- **Burden calculation**: aggregate-ratio method — pool `*_x_units` / `*_valid_units`
  within each tract×FPL group, then compute energy_cost / income
- **Zero-fuel rule**: if a fuel's `*_valid_units` sums to 0, that cost = 0 (not NA)
- **Drop rule**: if income `*_valid_units` = 0 or computed income ≤ 0, drop the group
  and track dropped households as a coverage figure
- **Costs are annual** (no ×12 needed; DOE LEAD stores annualized values)
- **Energy insecurity metrics**: three self-reported measures from HPS — forgo basic needs
  (`energy`), unsafe temperature (`hse_temp`), unable to pay bill (`enrgy_bill`) — plus a
  union measure (`energy_insecure`) = any of the three; computed from 2024 Phase 4 cycles only
- **YES / NO / NA coding**: YES = `almost_every_month | some_months | 1_or_2_months`;
  NO = `never`; NA = item non-response, excluded from denominator
- **Equal-cycle averaging**: per-cycle pct and yes_wt each averaged with equal weight across
  the 9 cycles of 2024; `pct_*` and `n_*` are independent averages, not algebraically linked
- **Union computation**: `insecure` flag set at the respondent level (person-level OR) so the
  union is a proper logical union, not a sum of marginals
- **Shutoff rates**: sum of 12 monthly per-customer rates (cumulative annual incidence);
  combined rates use `electric_customers` as denominator (proxy for total households);
  `pct_not_reconnected` = share of shutoffs not reversed by a reconnection (higher = worse);
  quality flags (`Q`/`R`) surfaced via `any_quality_flag` (Georgia gas, Texas elec notices)

## Key Files
- `R/01_load_lead_data.R` — reads parquet (selected columns only), drops FIPS 72 (PR),
  joins FIPS→state abbreviation crosswalk, sets `fpl150` as ordered factor; caches to `temp/`
- `R/02_calculate_energy_burden.R` — core analysis: tract×FPL aggregation, burden
  computation, affordable/unaffordable classification, state and FPL-per-state summaries,
  US rankings; writes three output CSVs
- `R/03_visualize_burden.R` — ggplot2 charts for presentation
- `R/08_visualize_burden_slide.R` — slide-ready energy-burden graphics for the pptx deck:
  the "income cliff" descending bar chart (household-weighted % unaffordable by FPL band,
  pooled across the ten states) and the national-context ribbon (ten RE-AMP states placed
  along the full 51-jurisdiction range). No title/subtitle/caption annotations (added in the
  deck). Uses `eeptheme` (`theme_eep_slide`, Inter font); blue is primary, orange is the
  secondary accent for the at-risk focus (severe bands; RE-AMP dots). Writes two high-res
  PNGs (white background, 300 dpi) to `plots/`
- `R/04_load_pulse_data.R` — reads HPS harmonized microdata, filters to 2024, selects 7
  columns, validates cycle/state counts; caches to `temp/pulse_2024_slim.rds`
- `R/05_calculate_energy_insecurity.R` — builds respondent-level YES flags and union,
  computes per-cycle weighted counts, equal-cycle averages, state rankings; writes two CSVs
- `R/06_calculate_shutoffs.R` — reads EIA 112 CSV, crosswalks state names to abbreviations,
  computes monthly rate columns, aggregates to annual counts + cumulative rates, quality-flags
  states, produces RE-AMP summary and US rankings; writes two CSVs
- `R/07_calculate_utility_profits.R` — reads EPI workbook (sheet "Data"), coerces character
  profit columns via `parse_number()`, strips footnote markers, attributes RE-AMP states via
  "any overlap" rule, computes 2021/2025 profit and PoB metrics plus change ratios, produces
  RE-AMP summary (31 utilities) and US rankings (110 utilities); writes two CSVs
